                Man this still aint ready
            </h1>
            <p>
                Yeah so some progress was made SO WHAT. Expecting my code to work and be ready in a timely matter at my stage of learning is not a good idea to hold. This is STILL SCUFFED and it aint getting better anytime soon.
